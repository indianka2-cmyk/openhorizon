# How to Contribute to Open Horizon

Welcome. You are not just contributing to a codebase, but to a **different philosophy of computing**.

## First Steps
1.  **Read.** Understand our [VISION](VISION.md) and [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md).
2.  **Discuss.** Join a [Discussion](https://github.com/yourusername/openhorizon/discussions). Ask questions, debate ideas. This is where the architecture is formed.
3.  **Learn.** Follow Phase 1 of the Roadmap. Your first contribution might be a detailed build log or a clarified tutorial.

## The "Resilience Points" Ethos (An Experiment)
We symbolically reward the work that makes systems last:
- **+Foundational Resilience:** Fixing a critical design flaw, submitting a verifiable security analysis.
- **+Clarity:** Writing documentation, creating a diagram, simplifying a complex concept.
- **+Stewardship:** Maintaining a key component (e.g., a translator server) over time.
- **+Germination:** Your first successful build, your first thoughtful discussion question.

This is a **merit system for maintainers**, not a leaderboard. It exists to highlight the often-invisible work that creates resilience.

## Technical Contributions
- **Code:** Small, reviewable changes. Heavily commented. Prefer safety and clarity over cleverness.
- **Documentation:** As valuable as code. Explain the *why*.
- **Review:** Thoughtful review of pull requests is a high-value contribution.

## The Pledge
By contributing, you align with the goal of building **sovereign, resilient, and user-empowering systems.** You agree to license your work under the project's copyleft license (GPLv3+) to ensure these freedoms are preserved for all future users.
