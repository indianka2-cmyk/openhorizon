# Contributing to Open Horizon

We value **Resilience, Clarity, and Sovereignty**.

## How to Start
1.  **Read** `VISION.md` and `ROADMAP.md`.
2.  **Join a Discussion** or start one.
3.  **Pick a "Resilience Task"** from the Roadmap.

## Resilience Points
This is a experimental contribution metric:
- **+100 Foundational Resilience:** Submitting a fix for a critical bug in core understanding.
- **+50 Clarity:** Writing exceptional documentation or a tutorial.
- **+30 Stewardship:** Maintaining a compatibility server (e.g., `server:ffmpeg` sandbox) for a release cycle.
- **+10 Germination:** Your first build log, first discussion question.

*Points are symbolic, reflecting a culture that rewards maintainers, not just feature makers.*

## Code & Pull Request Philosophy
- **Small, reviewable changes.**
- **Prefer safety and clarity over cleverness.**
- **Document the *why*, not just the *what*.**

## The Pledge
By contributing, you ally with the goal of building a more sovereign, resilient digital foundation.
